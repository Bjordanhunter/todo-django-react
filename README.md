# todo-django-react
a simple todo app to learn django and react following [this](https://www.section.io/engineering-education/react-and-django-rest-framework/) walkthough on section.io by Oruko Pius

Abandoned as of 29/6/22: Working except for the 'add task' popup. Not sure why, tried coping all code but its still not working, possibly due to version changes. May atempt to fix later.
